## Project Setup

- Initialized a Node.js project using `npm init`.
- Installed essential dependencies:  
    - Express (web framework)
    - Mongoose (MongoDB ODM)
    - dotenv (environment variables)
    - nodemon (development server)

## Environment Configuration

- Created a `.env` file to store sensitive information (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).
- Configured the app to load environment variables using `dotenv`.

## Database Integration

- Set up MongoDB as the database.
- Connected the backend to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Defined Mongoose schemas and models for core entities.

## API Development

- Built RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Structured routes using Express Router.
- Implemented controllers to handle business logic.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Integrated JWT-based authentication.
- Created middleware to protect private routes.
- Implemented user registration and login endpoints.

## Error Handling & Validation

- Added centralized error handling middleware.
- Used validation libraries (e.g., express-validator) to validate incoming requests.

## Testing

- Tested endpoints using Postman/Insomnia.
- Verified database operations and authentication flow.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Implement role-based access control.
- Improve API documentation (e.g., Swagger).
